    <h3>What Constitutes Extenuating Circumstances?</h3>
    <dl>

        <dt>Car troubles or Motorvehicle Accident</dt>
        <dd>If your car will not start and you have no other resources to make the photoshoot, it can be re-scheduled free of charge.<br>If you or anyone in the party is involved in an accident of this sort and can't make the scheduled time, the session can be rescheduled free of charge</dd>
        <dt>Facial Injuries</dt>
        <dd>If a member of the party scheduled for the photoshoot receives a facial injury, or any injury that would appear in the photos, you have the right to reschedule at any time. However, you must let the Rowan Rose team know at least 24 hours before if possible for the re-schedule fee to be avoided, $50.</dd>
